Log 5:
	Added a canvas on the left Jpanel.
	Fixed some bugs related to the Jpanel location and removed the mouse liistener form the canvas-jpanel and inherited it to its child (canvas)

Log 6:
	Created a Sprite, Tile, Entity, Level class.
	Changed a bit of the game engine logic: I made the canvas attach a level to it .. and the level is the responsible for the rendering of all of its components (Entities and tiles)

Log 7:
	Rendered the level to the canvas..


Log 8:
	Done the rendering Tiles with the best i could and simplest way i figured.
	Fixed the rendering method in the level class and added a new level.png


Log 9:
	Creating Character and player classes.
	shifting the level to the left and top once the canvas is created .. so position (0,0) is the center of the things you see in the display.
	editing the shifting to be centered around the player once it is created. and Added a move method to the player. ( I have to edit the move function in the player and make it independent from the character class. coz it will make problems

Log 10:
	adding a collision detection function to the Level.java and making it perfect. Plus i changed the move function a bit (distrubiting the check collision on defirent axis.

Future Plan:
	Creating Sprite class to handle specific sprites, and maybe creating an independent Tile class which represents the sprite.
	Creating a level class which allows you to create you own level design. The design can be taken from an image file.
	Fixing the GameCanvas rendering method and adding more functionality to it. Render Entity, for instance.
	Adding collision physics and buffs for the Sprite classes. some sprite classes requires special collision detection methods.
	Creating an Entity class to represent the independent objects as player, projectiles and particles.
	Adding enemies and basic AI.
	Creating a Healthbar an enemies Healthbars.
	Creating different weapons ( 3 Weapons states ) which can be chosen from the R.H.S panel
	Creating a Mini-Map which will be a representation of the map.
	Creating more functionality:	
		1: creating random weapon on the map with different damages and rates of fire.
		2: creating a special weapon which consumes some energy. Therefore, and energy bar will be created under the main health Bar.
