# World of war tanks/ world of tank wars

This is a simple 2d game with its engine written completely in java. You have the ability to create games with similarities using the game engine or you can enjoy the game as it is.

# Gameplay Discription
 
You play as a tank that has teh ability to navigate the level and shoot projectiles in different directions. Shooting other tanks can make them explode and particles will be thrown from them (simulating a real explosion).


# Note:

This game is just a prototype that has been done by me -almost a year ago, but has not uploaded it to github. Therefor, it lacks some details.


# Have fun playing and learning :)
